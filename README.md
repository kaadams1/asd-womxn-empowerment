The ASD Womxn Empowerment app was developed for Girl Development Hackathon 2022 and won the "Best Theme - or Most on Point Hackathon" award.

Autism is highly misunderstood and therefore stigmatized. Often people think of a rain man or Sheldon type character: male and either completely brilliant or completely unable to complete daily tasks. Unfortunately, the research, community, and resources reflect this bias toward boys and men. Autistic womxn and non-binary individuals are left out of the conversation. This leads to intense isolation and a decline in mental health and wellbeing. In addition, the suicide rate in this population is alarmingly high at 34%.

This all paints a grim picture of what it means to be autistic, but let me paint a new one for you. Autistic womxn and non-binary people have so much to give to not only their own communities but also to our global community. They have contributed to some of the greatest technological and artistic innovations of our species, as well as being valued, loving, and loyal members of the families they choose. Temple Grandin, a prominent autistic advocate likes to point out that "without autism, we wouldn't have electricity". We can only gain by creating inclusive spaces for neurodiversity.

That brings us to our app. Mental health and wellbeing are a prerequisite for truly authentic participation, contribution, and self-advocacy within any community. It is imperitive that Autistic Womxn & Nonbinary Individuals have a designated and consistent place to go when they feel like they are from another world. Our app creates a safe space for autistic womxn and nonbinary individuals to improve their wellbeing through community, acceptance, self-expression & identity, and empowerment.

## <a name="features"></a> Features

The core features of our app are presented in a single dashboard view, providing a simple user interface with everything accessible in one place. The first feature the user encounters is a random image that generates every time the app is opened. The purpose of the image to create a calm and relaxing environment.

#### Daily Resource

The Daily Resource component of the app delivers information relevant to autism, highlighting recent news, research, and inspiring stories about autistic and neurodiverse people.

#### Daily Activity

The Daily Activity component suggest and activity for the user to participate in, promoting general wellness. There are 4 categories that the user would be able to set preferences for, and the app generates a daily activity for the user to complete. As the user completes an activity, they can rate and reflect on their experience to keep track of their progress.

#### Profile Page

The profile page was created to help build a community, where users can connect with others in the community and share information about themselves. On this page, users will also find a visual representation of their activity trackers so they can easily see all they have accomplished.
